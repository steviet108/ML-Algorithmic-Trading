Optimizing Trading Signals with Machine Learning

---

This jupyter notebook file includes:

- Algorithmic trading strategy that uses machine learning to automate trade decisions.
- Adjusted input parameters to optimize the trading algorithim.
- A Summary of 2 distinct machine learning models and a comparison of performance of tuned models to baseline model.

## Technologies

This project uses Python 3.7 with the following packages and modules:

-Pandas

-Numpy

-Pathlib

-Matplotlib

-Sklearn


## Installation Guide

This analysis was done with Pandas in Jupyter Lab. If the User wants to interact with the Machine Learning Model, first install the following:
  To get started using this application please go to [Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and select the version for your operating system. Then install the following libraries and packages.

``` sudo apt install python3-pip ```. This will install the pip that will make it easier to install the libraries.

``` pip install pandas ```

``` pip install numpy ```

``` pip install -U scikit-learn ```

``` python -m pip install -U pip ```

``` python -m pip install -U matplotlib ```
